# TODO

## Backtrace is a project designed to obscure and ultimately hide a program's stack trace, enhancing security and preventing reverse engineering.

#### Identify the Target Program: Determine and analyze the program you want to modify:

## Understand Stack Traces: Research how stack traces are generated in the target program:

## Code Injection: Develop a program to inject code into the target process's memory:

# Dynamic Linking: Intercept calls to functions generating stack traces using dynamic linking:

# Testing and Validation: Test your modified program extensively to ensure correct behavior:

## Considering Alternatives: Explore other security measures such as code obfuscation or intrusion detection systems.



## The Problem Statement:

Entropy is the measurement of  how disorganised a system is.

Every Program written has a degree of entropy, This is denoted by shannon entropoy forumla:

```mathematica
$$
H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i)
$$
Where $$ p(xi​)$$ is the probability of character $$x_i$$​.
```

Using this we can accurately measure entropy,
